# React shopping App 🛒

###### This is just an \[🔬 experiment\].

#### Description:
A React with Redux experiment on creating a shopping app. [try it live](http://francescorizzi.info/experiments/react-shopping-app)

I tried to imagine this app in a **supermarket context**, where there are **touch-screen stations** where (using this software) people can select, order and pre-pay their virtual shopping basket.

 **The supermarket staff collect the items** from the warehouse and give them to **the customers**.

 Maybe it could fit well in the vegetables section of a supermarket, so people don’t have to touch and collect fruits and vegetables themselves, but **just select, pay and find their shopping when leaving**.

The flow is simple, select or edit what you like, then checkout and get your recipe.

 The station will print the repice and then **the software auto-reset itself for a new customer** (updating the customer ID as well).

Redux manages the state and takes care of keeping all the different UI components updated.
All transitions are CSS based.
